You wonder if the [bear] you encountered last night could still be close by.
You hear the howling of [wolves] in the distance reminding you to stay quiet.
Suddenly you hear voices unlike any you've heard.  Could they belong to the [ogre mages] rumored to inhabit these parts?
You hear the clattering of hooves belonging to a horse.  You wonder what kind of [horseman] would be riding all the way out here? Friend or foe?
You hope not to encounter the native [tribesman of Beelzebub] known to wander these parts.
The evil [enchantress] who calls the nearby surroundings her home has yet to detect your presence, or so you have been led to believe.
