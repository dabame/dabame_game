You wonder if the [bear] you encountered last night could still be close by.
You hear the howling of [wolves] in the distance reminding you to stay quiet.
Suddenly you hear voices unlike any you've heard.  Could they belong to the [ogre mages] rumored to inhabit these parts?
You hear the clattering of hooves belonging to a horse.  You wonder what kind of [horseman] would be riding all the way out here? Friend or foe?
