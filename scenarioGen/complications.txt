You are [cold], shivering, and last nights encounter has left you [unarmed].
You [thirst] for water as you found none yesterday and a sharp [leg pain] impedes your mobility.
Your head aches from [lack of sleep] and you've aquired a [hunger] over the past days with no food.
You hope the snake bite you aquired on your journey here is not [poison]ous.  But the aching only seems to grow stronger as time passes.
