Your thoughts turn to your children, but you know you can't go back until you [slay the beast] that has been terrorizing your village.
The oddity of your surroundings sends shivers down your back and you know you must [find your sister] before night fall.
The [hidden treasure] must be near and you've come too far to turn back now.
You remind yourself that the [Stone of Ages] will be the answer to all your problems, if you can just recover it.
You begin to wonder if your map to [Atlantis] has been interpretted correctly.
You wonder which way the thievs went.  They could not have gotten far with the [Ancient Scrolls].
The home of the [Dark Seer] cannot be far now.
