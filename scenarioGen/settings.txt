You wake up lost in a <clearing> of a dark [forest].
You find yourself at the <cave>'s entrance deep in an unknown [forest].
The thickness of the [forest] appears to have <thin>ned out as the sunlight blinds your wakening eyes.
You can't remember which way you came from as the <thick>ness of the [forest] has left you disoriented.
The <edge> of the [forest] feels near but there is no way to be certain.
The babbling of the adjacent <stream> brings you comfort as the silence of the [forest] has kept you on edge these past hours.
